# Byre

Byre is a rough fork of the Cloudflare Foundations with some bits copied directly and others used as inspiration. Byre differs from Foundations in the ecosystems that it draws from. 

Byre is a toolbox for bootstrapping services quickly. Providing tracing, logging, configuration file  generation and loading, and command line argument parsing.

Byre leans on tracing, opentelemetry, clap, doku, and others.
